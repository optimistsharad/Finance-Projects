# Advanced Options Trading Engine for Indian Markets

This repository contains a comprehensive, production-ready automated options trading engine developed specifically for the Indian financial markets, focusing on NIFTY 50 options. The system integrates advanced quantitative finance models, machine learning techniques, and rigorous risk management to systematically identify and exploit trading opportunities with superior risk-adjusted returns.

- **Mathematical Models:** Implements the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with full Greeks calculations, Monte Carlo simulations for European and exotic options, and GARCH models for volatility forecasting.
- **Machine Learning:** Employs Random Forest regression for price prediction and signal generation based on technical indicators and historical price data.
- **Risk Management:** Utilizes Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), and Kelly Criterion-based position sizing for effective capital preservation.
- **Trading Strategy Engine:** Combines quantitative signals from pricing, volatility, and machine learning models to generate actionable buy/sell signals for options trading.
- **Backtesting Framework:** Validates strategy performance against market benchmarks, providing detailed metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and overall portfolio returns.
- **Performance Visualization:** Includes comprehensive charts and dashboards to analyze market data, pricing surfaces, strategy outcomes, and model diagnostics.
- **Production Ready:** Includes detailed package installation steps, error handling, modular design, and documentation explaining each step and model being implemented.
